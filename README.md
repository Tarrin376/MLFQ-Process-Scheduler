# 🧠 MLFQ Process Scheduler (CLI)

A command-line simulation of a **Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)** scheduler in Java, using the **Round-Robin algorithm** at each level for fair and responsive process management.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧩 Multi-level ready queues with configurable quantum & allotment per level
- ⏱️ Accurate tracking of:
  - Average Turnaround Time
  - Response Time
  - Waiting Time
  - CPU Utilization
- 🧵 I/O blocking and unblocking with scheduling effects
- 🎛️ Adjustable parameters: number of queues, boost/reset intervals, quantum and allotment times, and more!
- 🖥️ Interactive Command-Line Interface for job management and live control
- 📊 Visual representation of queues and job scheduling

---

## 📦 Example Usage

```bash
> add-job P1 0 20
> add-io disk-read P1 5 10
> show-mlfq
> show-job P1
> resume # Resumes the simulation

# During execution:
# 📌 Press ENTER at any time to pause the simulation and enter command mode
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/Tarrin376/MLFQ-Process-Scheduler.git
> cd MLFQ-Process-Scheduler
```

2. Compile and run the project
```bash
> javac *.java
> java Main.java
```

---

## 🧾 Commands

```bash
> add-job <pid> <arrival_time> <end_time> # Adds a new job to the scheduler e.g. add-job P1 0 20
> add-io <io_name> <pid> <arrival_time> <end_time> # Adds an I/O event for a job e.g. add-io disk-read P1 5 10
> show-mlfq # Displays the current state of the MLFQ
> show-metrics # Displays the metrics of the MLFQ, including CPU utilisation, average response time, and more
> show-job <pid> # Displays details of a specific job e.g. show-job P1
> resume # Resumes the simulation after a pause
> exit # Stops the simulation and exits the program
```
